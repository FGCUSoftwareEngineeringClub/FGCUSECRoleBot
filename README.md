# FGCU SEC Role Bot

**Welcome!**

This bot runs on the Software Engineering Club Discord [[Join Here](https://discord.gg/grwMCNt)] and helps to assign roles to new users and to help preexisting users change their roles without help.

This Github also exists to help people learn how to make their own bots! We'll be adding documentation so that users can follow along!

This bot runs using Node.js, a way of running Javascript on the server, and the [Discord.js](https://discord.js.org/) library for connecting to the Discord server.
